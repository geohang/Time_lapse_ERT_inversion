# Time_lapse_ERT_inversion
This project includes the windowed time-lapse ERT inversion codes for the BATS and HOTBENT projects. 

The file directory:

-BATS: Orignal codes for inverting the BAT2 data
-HOTBENT:  Orignal codes for inverting the HOTBENT data
-Generalized: Modified codes for general problems
                - 2D problem
                - 3D subsurface
                - 3D column problem
Note:
It will be eaiser to directly see the codes in the Generalized file directory. The codes in Generalized file are fully commented. The other two file directories are raw codes I used for projects. The
